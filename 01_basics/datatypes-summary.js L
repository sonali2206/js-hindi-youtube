// JS is dynamically typed languages, type checking takes place at runtime or execution time. 
This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing. 
Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript, 
Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and Tcl.

// how to place data in memory & access data there are 2 types Primitive & non primitive

//  Primitive - call by value (changes in copy not original one)

//  7 types : String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

const score = 100
const scoreValue = 100.3

const isLoggedIn = false
const outsideTemp = null
let userEmail;

const id = Symbol('123')
const anotherId = Symbol('123')

console.log(id === anotherId);

// const bigNumber = 3456543576654356754n



// Reference (Non primitive) - call by Reference

// Array, Objects, Functions

const heros = ["shaktiman", "naagraj", "doga"];
let myObj = {
    name: "hitesh",
    age: 22,
}

const myFunction = function(){
    console.log("Hello world");
}

console.log(typeof anotherId);
